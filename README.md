# Terraform AWS Multi-Environment Infrastructure

This project demonstrates provisioning AWS infrastructure using **Terraform modules, remote state management, and environment-based deployments.**

The infrastructure includes networking, compute resources, and secure state management following real-world DevOps practices.

---

## 🚀 Architecture

The infrastructure provisions:

- Custom **AWS VPC**
- **Public and Private Subnets**
- **Internet Gateway**
- **Route Tables**
- **EC2 Instance**
- **Security Group**
- **Terraform Remote State (S3)**
- **State Locking using DynamoDB**

## ⚙️ Terraform Workflow

Initialize Terraform
$ terraform init

Preview infrastructure changes
$ terraform plan

Deploy infrastructure
$ terraform apply

Destroy infrastructure
$ terraform destroy

## 🔐 Remote State Management

Terraform state is stored securely using:

- **AWS S3** for remote state storage
- **DynamoDB** for state locking

This ensures safe collaboration when multiple engineers manage the same infrastructure.
